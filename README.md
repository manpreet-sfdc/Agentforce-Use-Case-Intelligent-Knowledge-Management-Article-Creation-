# 🤖 Agentforce Use Case — Intelligent Knowledge Management & Article Creation  

## 🎯 Objective
Automate and optimize **Knowledge Article creation, maintenance, and retrieval** using **Agentforce**.  
Reduce manual effort by agents, improve article accuracy, and ensure real-time content updates from customer interactions.

---

## 🧠 Overview
When support agents resolve cases, **Agentforce** automatically:
- 📝 Summarizes the case resolution.
- 🧾 Suggests a draft **Knowledge Article (KA)**.
- 🏷️ Classifies and tags it under relevant product areas.
- 🚀 Publishes or recommends it for manager review.

At the same time, for new cases:
- Agentforce retrieves and ranks the **most relevant articles**.
- Suggests **AI-generated responses** for the agent to send directly.

---

## ⚙️ Implementation Flow

### 1️⃣ Case Resolution Capture
When a case is closed, a **Flow** triggers an Apex class that sends case details to the LLM.

**Prompt Example:**
> “Summarize this case resolution as a reusable knowledge article. Include title, problem, symptoms, resolution steps, and tags.”

---

### 2️⃣ AI Drafts the Knowledge Article
Agentforce returns a structured JSON response:

```json
{
  "Title": "Unable to Log In Due to Multi-Factor Error",
  "Problem": "User unable to log in due to expired MFA token.",
  "Symptoms": "Repeated login failures, invalid MFA prompt.",
  "Resolution": "Reset MFA settings via Security Center. Re-register device.",
  "Tags": ["Login", "Security", "MFA", "Authentication"]
}
```

The data is then used to create a draft Knowledge Article (Knowledge__kav) record.

3️⃣ Knowledge Review & Approval
•	Knowledge Managers receive a notification for review.
•	AI suggestions appear under “Suggested Articles.”
•	Once approved → Article is published to the Knowledge Base.
 
4️⃣ AI-Powered Retrieval for New Cases
When a new case arrives:
1.	Agentforce analyzes the case subject/description.
2.	It retrieves the top 3 relevant articles using semantic similarity.
3.	Generates a case comment or email draft referencing the relevant solution.
 
5️⃣ Continuous Improvement
•	Agents provide feedback (used/rejected).
•	AI refines future suggestions.
•	Obsolete or underused articles are flagged for review automatically.
 
| Component                        | Description                                |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Case**                         | Source for AI-generated knowledge articles |
| **Knowledge__kav**               | Target for storing AI-drafted articles     |
| **Named Credential**             | Secure API access for LLM                  |
| **Apex Class**                   | Handles summarization and draft creation   |
| **Autolaunched Flow**            | Triggers Apex after case closure           |
| **Quick Action**                 | “AI: Suggest Knowledge Article”            |
| **Agentforce / Einstein Search** | Ranks relevant articles                    |
| **Dashboard**                    | Monitors article accuracy and usage        |


🧰 Sample Apex Code

```
public with sharing class AIKnowledgeService {
    @AuraEnabled
    public static Map<String,Object> generateKnowledge(Id caseId) {
        Case c = [SELECT Id, Subject, Description, Resolution__c FROM Case WHERE Id = :caseId LIMIT 1];
        String prompt = 'Summarize the following case into a reusable knowledge article:\n' + c.Description + '\nResolution:\n' + c.Resolution__c;

        HttpRequest req = new HttpRequest();
        req.setEndpoint('callout:LLM_Named_Cred/v1/generate');
        req.setMethod('POST');
        req.setHeader('Content-Type','application/json');
        req.setBody(JSON.serialize(new Map<String,Object>{ 'prompt' => prompt, 'max_tokens' => 800 }));
        
        Http http = new Http();
        HttpResponse res = http.send(req);
        return (Map<String,Object>) JSON.deserializeUntyped(res.getBody());
    }
}

```
